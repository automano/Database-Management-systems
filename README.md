This is a set of four projects:

1. HeapFiles: We constructed Tuple (basic building block of a table), a Catalog that keeps track of what tables are currently in the database and provides a way to access them and HeapFiles which are the physical representation of the data in our database.

2. RelationalOperationsAndQueries: In this project, we implemented relational operations and then used JSQLParser to help translate SQL queries into these relational operations, allowing users to query the data stored on the server.

3. BPlusTrees: We implemented B+ trees and integrated them with our database.

4. Locking: We implemented strict two phase locking mechanism that can be used with transactions to ensure data consistency and avoid deadlocks in the DBMS.
